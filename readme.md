# Llama 3B Model with 1.58-bit Quantization

### TODO
[ ] Integrate the new CUDA function

## Introduction

The Llama 3B model represents a groundbreaking advancement in natural language processing and machine learning. This version of the model is enhanced with a 1.58-bit quantization technique, significantly optimizing its efficiency and computational resource usage without compromising the model's performance. This innovative approach allows for faster inference times and reduced model size, making it ideal for deployment in environments with limited resources.

## About 1.58-bit Quantization

Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of the model's weights, leading to a smaller model size and faster computation. The 1.58-bit quantization refers to a highly efficient quantization scheme that minimizes memory usage and computational costs while maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the model. This specific bit-level precision offers a balanced trade-off between performance and resource utilization, making it particularly suitable for edge devices and low-power applications.

## Installation

To install the Llama 3B model with 1.58-bit quantization, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/llama-3b-quantized.git
cd llama-3b-quantized
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed, along with the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to load and use the model:

```python
from llama_3b_quantized import Llama3BQuantized

model = Llama3BQuantized()
text = "Your input text here"
output = model.predict(text)
print(output)
```
